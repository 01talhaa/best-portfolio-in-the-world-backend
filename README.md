## 🛠️ Helper Scripts

All scripts are located in the `scripts/` directory and are executable:

### Create Branch
Creates a new branch following the branching strategy:
```bash
./scripts/create-branch.sh <type> <name>

# Examples:
./scripts/create-branch.sh feature user-authentication
./scripts/create-branch.sh bugfix login-error
./scripts/create-branch.sh hotfix critical-security-patch
./scripts/create-branch.sh release v1.2.0
```

### Update Branch
Updates your current branch with latest changes from base branch:
```bash
./scripts/update-branch.sh

# Automatically detects base branch and offers merge or rebase
```

### Safe Merge
Performs a safe merge with all necessary checks:
```bash
./scripts/safe-merge.sh <source-branch> <target-branch>

# Examples:
./scripts/safe-merge.sh feature/user-auth develop
./scripts/safe-merge.sh develop staging
```

### Conflict Helper
Interactive tool for resolving merge conflicts:
```bash
./scripts/conflict-helper.sh

# Provides options to:
# - View conflicts
# - Accept current/incoming changes
# - Open files for manual resolution
# - Abort or continue merge
```

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Setting Up a New Feature

1. Create a feature branch:
   ```bash
   ./scripts/create-branch.sh feature my-new-feature
   ```

2. Make your changes and commit:
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "Add new feature"
   git push origin feature/my-new-feature
   ```

3. Keep your branch updated:
   ```bash
   ./scripts/update-branch.sh
   ```

4. Create a Pull Request on GitHub

5. After approval, merge safely:
   ```bash
   ./scripts/safe-merge.sh feature/my-new-feature develop
   ```

## 🔀 Branching Model

```
main (production)
  ↑
  |-- hotfix/fix-name
  |
staging (pre-production)
  ↑
develop (integration)
  ↑
  |-- feature/feature-name
  |-- bugfix/bug-name
  |-- release/v1.0.0
```

## 🎯 Feature Flags

Feature flags allow you to deploy code without immediately releasing features:

```javascript
const { isFeatureEnabled } = require('./config/featureFlags');

if (isFeatureEnabled('NEW_FEATURE')) {
  // New implementation
} else {
  // Old implementation
}
```

See [FEATURE_FLAGS.md](FEATURE_FLAGS.md) for complete implementation details.

## ⚠️ Conflict Resolution

When you encounter merge conflicts:

1. Run the conflict helper:
   ```bash
   ./scripts/conflict-helper.sh
   ```

2. Or resolve manually:
   ```bash
   # View conflicts
   git status
   
   # Edit conflicted files
   nano <file>
   
   # Mark as resolved
   git add <file>
   
   # Complete merge
   git commit
   ```

See [CONFLICT_RESOLUTION.md](CONFLICT_RESOLUTION.md) for detailed guidance.
